# 🤖 Sub-Agents Discovery Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
Claude Code was not discovering the sub-agents because they lacked proper YAML frontmatter format.

## Root Cause
Sub-agent files in `.claude/agents/` need specific YAML frontmatter with:
- `name`: Agent display name
- `description`: Agent description  
- `tools`: List of allowed tools

## Solution Applied ✅

### Fixed All 6 Sub-Agents
Each agent now has proper frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: "Agent Name"
description: "Agent description"
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Other", "Tools"]
---
```

### Agents Fixed:
1. **✅ Product Manager** - Market analysis, PRD creation
2. **✅ Project Manager** - Progress tracking, risk management  
3. **✅ QA Specialist** - Test automation, quality reporting
4. **✅ DevOps Engineer** - Deployment, monitoring, infrastructure
5. **✅ Technical Architect** - System design, code review
6. **✅ Security Engineer** - Security assessment, compliance

## Verification Status ✅

**Verification Script Results:**
- ✅ 6 agent files with valid frontmatter
- ✅ 12 command files properly structured
- ✅ Configuration files complete
- ✅ All format requirements met

## Testing Commands

Now these commands should work:
```bash
# List available agents
claude /agents

# Test specific agent commands
claude /product:analyze --help
claude /project:progress --help
claude /qa:create --help
claude /deploy:prep --help
```
